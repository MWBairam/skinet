        Note:
        instead of adding IGenericRepository<Product>,  IGenericRepository<DeliveryMethod> and IGenericRepository<Order>,
        (IGenericRepository for the different Models) 
        the lecturer used the UnitOfWork to protect from having partial updates, in video 260 and I did not use that !!)
        (also the lecturer used that in OrderServcice, in video 218 219, but I did not use that !!)
        
        the importance of this is:
        for example, example away from the Payment, 
        doing modifications on ProductBrands and Products at the same time, 
        and when we call the requiered methods from the same IGeneric repo, each repo of the instantiated repos will have its own copy (instance) of DbContext (storeContext). 
        Then if the modification on Product successes, but the one in ProductBrand does not ! so we will have a partial update ! and we have to deal with products for a brand that does not exist !
        So we will implement the concept of Unit of Work, which creates one instance of the DbContext for all the instantiated repos, and which rolles back all the changes if any single modification fails to be implemented !
