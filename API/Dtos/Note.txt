In this folder,
we create Data Transfer objects (DTOs).
Those are the propertiese we need to only recieve/return in our controller instead of recieving/returning all the properties identified in Core project, Entities folder.
For the DTOs which identifies the properties to be recieved, should match the models in Client project, src/app/shared/models 

e.g:
In OrdersController we have this method:
"public async Task<ActionResult<Order>> CreateOrder(OrderDto orderDto)"
it should receive (in the https put request body) an object has properties identified in the OrderDto.
so make sure that angular client side sends to use thos properties onlt. so in src/app/shared/models identify for example IOrder for that.

so that we are not sending all the properties identified in the Core project, Entities/OrderAggregate/Order.cs model.

e.g:
"public async Task<ActionResult<OrderToReturnDto>> GetOrderByIdForUser(int id)" 
it gets from the DB an order from "Orders" table,
this order has all the fields (properties) in Core project, Entities/OrderAggregate/Order.cs model.
we do not want to return all of these, so we can shape the response in OrderToReturnDto.
