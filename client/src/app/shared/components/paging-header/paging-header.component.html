<!--  
if we want to write the html code of this pagination-header in shop.component.html, we will write this: 
<header>
    <span *ngIf="totalCount && totalCount>0"> //// perform the following if totalcount is bigger than 0 (there are results)
        
        Showing 
        
        <strong>
            {{ ( (this.shopParams.pageNumber-1) * (this.shopParams.pageSize) ) +1 }} 
            to
            {{
                (this.shopParams.pageNumber * this.shopParams.pageSize)
                > this.totalCount
                ? this.totalCount
                : (this.shopParams.pageNumber * this.shopParams.pageSize)
            }}
        </strong> 
        //// the "to" part is an "if" expression, which syas if pageNumber*pageSize is bigger than totalcount of returned items, 
            so "to" will be to totalcount, else, it is pageNumber*pageSize. 
            it is good when we filter based in brandId and typeId so that we show for example: "showing 1 to 5 of 5 Resutls" 
            instead of: "showing 1 to 5 of 3 Results" !!  ////
            
            of 
        <strong>
            {{this.totalCount}}
        </strong> 
        
        Results
    </span>
    <span *ngIf="totalCount === 0">
        There are 
        <strong>
            0
        </strong>
        results for this filter
    </span>
</header>

<!-- but we will use this pagination-header.component.html in shop.component.html, so we will write the following here:-->
<header>
    <span *ngIf="totalCount && totalCount>0"> <!-- perform the following if totalcount is bigger than 0 (there are results) -->

        <strong>

            {{
                (this.pageNumber * this.pageSize)
                > this.totalCount
                ? this.totalCount
                : (this.pageNumber * this.pageSize)
            }}
