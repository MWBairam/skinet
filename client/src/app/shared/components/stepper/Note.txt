  //no constructor is used or needed. any way, if we want to write a one, we should also inherit the one from CdkStepper.
  //I wrote a sample of that in the note file here in this folder, becuase writing that in a comment caused a problem in vs code !!!!!!

  /*
  //2-constructor:
  constructor() {}
  if we want this constructor, we should extend it to cover the inherited component CdkStepper, so it will be:
   constructor() 
   {
     super(_dir: Directionality, _changeDetectorRef: ChangeDetectorRef, _elementRef?: ElementRef<HTMLElement> | undefined, _document?: any);
   }
  but we will not use it !
